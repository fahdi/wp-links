== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I nofollow links I insert in my posts or pages? =
Just check the `add rel="nofollow" to link` option direction under the default `open link in a new window/tab` option.

= How do I use the shortcode? =
You can use any of these shortcodes to insert a nofollowed link `[relnofollow]`, `[nofollow]`, `[nofol]`, `[nofo]`, or `[nf]` using the following format:

`[nf href="http://link-url.com"]Link Text[/nf]`

You can also include the optional <a> attributes `title` and `target`. A full example would look like:

`[nf href="http://link-url.com" title="Link Title" target="_blank"]Link Text[/nf]`
